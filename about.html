							<h3>I'm a <strog>developer</strog>!</h3>
						</header>
						<p>My name is <strong>Krzysztof</strong> and I'm working as a <strong>.NET developer</strong>, but right now this not only a job - this is my hobby. It started as a part job during the study, just to have an extra cash and there you go - 6 years have passed.</p>

							<h3>I'm a <strong>self-learner</strong>!</h3>
						</header>
						<p>In the same way how I became a .NET developer I like to learn new things. Currently, I'm fascinated about <strong>F#</strong> (still .NET world) and <strong>Machine Learning</strong>. In my ML, F# plays a major role but I want to introduce other languages like python, scala or R which are widely used in such area.</p>

							<h3>I'm a <strong>blog enthusiast</strong> (and a newbie)!</h3>
						</header>
						<p>The idea of writing a blog appeared a really long time ago. I was trying many times but each time I failed. Why is this time different? This time I'm inspired by <strong>John Z. Sonmez</strong> and his <strong><cite><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/soft-skills">Soft Skills</a></cite></strong>. I know that this time is not perfect but I'm working on it to go so close as possible.</p>
